    <h2>Gustav Klimt</h2>
    <h4>Baumgarten, Austria | 1862 - 1918</h4>
    <p>Gustav Klimt was a painter born in 1862 in Vienna. He is considered a leader of the Viennese Modern Art Movement. He is best known for his paintings of women, which sometimes landed him in scrutiny due to the erotic themes and imagery.</p>
    <p>Klimt was classically trained in architectural painting at the University of Applied Arts Vienna. His early work was very logical and traditional.  He transitioned his architectural work to creating murals, which is where he began to get public recognition and praise. He even received a medal of honor for said murals. Klimt’s early personal life was tumultuous: he lost both his father and brother, and he was rumored to have fathered fourteen children.</p>

    <p>Klimt is also known to be a leader of the Vienna Succession of 1897. This group was formed as a reaction to the Association of Austrian Artists, who forced a much more traditional view on art.</p>
    <p>Klimt was commissioned by the University of Vienna to paint three murals on the ceiling of a University building. He created three paintings that were heavily criticized for being too pornographic. Leaders of religion, politics, and art all protested his pieces so heavily that they were never put on display. Klimt continued to push the boundaries with his art, creating pieces that dared to display sexuality in a far more graphic way than most other artists at the time.</p>

    <p>Gustav Klimt entered his “Golden Era” at the turn of the 20th century. He had begun to see financial success, followed by critical acclaim. His pieces used rich jewel tones accompanied by an excessive use of gold leaf. This is when he painted his most notable pieces: The Kiss and the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I.</p>
    <p>Despite such success, Klimt preferred to lead a simple life, largely in isolation. His mother died in 1915, which took a serious toll on the artist. He died three years later of influenza, at the height of the epidemic.</p>

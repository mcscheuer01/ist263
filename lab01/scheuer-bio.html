        <title>Molly Scheuer - Bio</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        My name is Molly Scheuer, and I am a senior at Syracuse University in the School of Information Studies. I am studying Information Management and Technology with concentrations in Data Analytics and Digital Retail Strategies, and hope to go into data analytics in the music or fashion industry. I have experience as an undergraduate TA in a SQL lab, interned at a music-tech startup, and am currently the head fashion editor at Zipped Magazine. I grew up in Berkeley, California but have spent much of my life back and forth between London, where my dad was born and raised. Spending time in these two amazing cities has given me a love for design, music, and food. I start every day by doing the New York Times crossword puzzle (my current record for the mini is seven seconds).
